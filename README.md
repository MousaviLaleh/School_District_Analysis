# School District Analysis

## Project Overview

Analysis on school district performance using Pandas library, Numpy library, and Jupyter Notebook with Python.<br/>

In this project we will work with Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, provide the initial analysis based on data collected from many schools and students across the school district.
The School Board would like to understand various performance metrics at the district and school level. This analysis will assist the school board and superintendent in making decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities.

## Purpose

While the School Board is pleased with the insight that we have provided, it has been identified that there is some anomalies in the data, in particular in the math and reading scores of the grade Nine students at Thomas High School. 
In order to ensure these results do not skew the analysis, the Boad has asked us to again work with Maria to remove the impact of these results by changing all the grade 9 Thomas High School math and reading scores to Nan ( which is a null value ).

### Resources


## Analysis Result

Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:
    How is the district summary affected?
    How is the school summary affected?
    How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
    How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
    Math and reading scores by grade
    Scores by school spending
    Scores by school size
    Scores by school type


### Affect on District Analysis

### Affect on Scores by School Spending


### Affect on Scores by School Size


### Affect on Scores by School Type


## Summary
Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
